# Book Of Apps for Statistics Teaching

The apps in this collection are the work of twenty undergraduate students majoring in Statistics at Penn State University. The students took part in the BOAST program in 2017 or 2018 (BOAST = Book Of Apps for Statistics Teaching). The program included either a DataCamp course on Shiny (2018) or a full day [workshop](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots17/workshop/5) at the U.S. Conference On Teaching Statistics on Developing R Shiny Applications to Enhance Teaching and Learning presented by Justin Post and Herle McGowan from North Carolina State University (2017). This was followed by a full-time summer research experience developing the apps in this collection throughout the months of June and July. Finally, the **_BOAST_** students take part in a one-credit research class in Fall semester to showcase their work to statistics instructors, prepare a survey and IRB application to get student feedback in a human subjects research setting, and then formally test their apps in a live class. Besides gaining expertise in R and R Shiny, the students gained a deeper understanding of selected statistical concepts and learned crucial skills in the team-based reproducible development of software (e.g. though the use of the GitHub platform). This book is laid out in eleven chapters with four at the introductory level covering topics in **Data Gathering**, **Data Description**, **Basic Probability**, and **Statistical Inference** and with seven chapters at the upper division level covering **Probability**, **Regression**, **ANOVA**, **Time Series**, **Sampling**, **Categorical Data**, and **Data Science**.
